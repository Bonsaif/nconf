Release 1.3.0 (tbd...)

FIXED   a bug with the $SUPERADMIN_GROUPS array (array couldn't be unset). Also, superadmin groups are now listed first in the 'contact_groups' attr,
        allowing users to place the '+' sign in the beginning (useful to control inheritance of contact_groups from templates).
FIXED   a bug with 'generate_config' causing an endless loop and 100% CPU load. Root cause was a faulty implementation of the
        macro replacement function. Fixed a second bug that prevented macros from being added to service parameters.
FIXED   ordering of checkcommands with empty 'default service name'
FIXED   attribute ordering. Modifying or creating new attributes will not cause duplicate order numbers any more.
        Order numbers will now be changed / re-arranged automatically.
FIXED   a bug in displaying static links like 'generate nagios config' in the last user menu box, instead of 'Basic Items'
FIXED   security bug on 'call_ajax.php' -> new file handler implemented 'call_file.php' which also does not allow going out of directory structure
FIXED   'Reset'-button did not reset all input fields, now it will reload the page to make a real reset for all changed stuff
FIXED   multimodiy and multidelete: amount of selected items was limited, because of apache 'LimitRequestLine Directive'.
        This is fixed with a change from GET to POST.
FIXED   some bugs with the way the Nagios importer parses uncommented lines in the Nagios configuration files; added check for prepending '+' characters
        in attributes to be imported.
FIXED   the way history entries are added for created or cloned services. Also, changes from host to services via inheritance will be tracked in history.
FIXED   a bug when adding a service over a host's "service" view. All attributes (also invisible ones) and their predefined values are added correctly.
FIXED   a bug when modifying services where it was possible to change a service name to the same as an other on the same host.
FIXED   services created over "add service" (in the main menu), did not check if the servicename is already taken by an other service on the host.
FIXED   a bug with assign_* attributes when an item name ended with an underscore "_"
FIXED   crypt will now work as expected (CRYPT_SALT not used anymore)

ADDED   NConf can now handle 'modules'
ADDED   new deployment module, see documentation for details
ADDED   jQuery - most GUIs will also load jQuery and use its functionality
ADDED   jQuery UI - most elements are designed with jQuery UI and use its themeroller styles.
ADDED   option 'illegal_object_name_chars' to test nagios.cfg file which is used for syntax checking. This is to make sure that generated 
        configuration files containing illegal chars in object names cannot be deployed anymore.
ADDED   'link_bidirectional' flag to allow attributes of type 'assign_*' to be visible in both classes that are linked to eachother
ADDED   'class_type' attribute to ConfigClasses table to discern between 'global', 'monitor' and 'collector' classes
ADDED   basic DB check (should detect a corrupt NConf DB and inform accordingly)
ADDED   check for existing classes or attributes, to detect possible conflicts during an update
ADDED   a script which exports items in the NConf database in different formats ('bin/get_items.pl'). It is intended for debugging purposes. 
ADDED   'call_file.php' -> replaces 'call_ajax.php' (security bug) and handles also the new modules-files
ADDED   'class: NConf_DEBUG' which helps handling DEBUG, INFO, ERROR and CRITICAL warnings.
ADDED   'class: NConf_HTML' which helps printing output of DEBUG. It also stores some functions(templates) to allow generating some HTML outputs.
ADDED   optional constant 'DEBUG_GENERATE' for debugging config generation proccess (loglevel 1-5)
ADDED   handle_item.php -> replaces the old add/modify/multimodify GUIs
ADDED   help button with info text on add/modify Attributes/Classes (administration part) (jQuery)
ADDED   Attribute 'command_param_count' can also handle 0 (zero) arguments. The GUI will not show any input.
ADDED   classes 'host-dependency' and 'service-dependency' including their attributes.
ADDED   NConf file check: checks critical files (and directories) for read/write -able and if files exists/are removed, otherwise a critical error is thrown
ADDED   "service_enabled" attribute for services. Setting it to "no" will prevent a service entry from being written to the configuration.
ADDED   "hostgroup_members", "servicegroup_members" and "contactgroup_members" attributes to their respective classes.
ADDED   "service_template" attribute to checkcommand class. This allows one to specify a service-template to be applied to all services using a command.
ADDED   "default_service_dependency" attributes to checkcommand class. This allows NConf to auto-create service-dependencies for services on the same host.
ADDED   "template inheritance" view on the detail page of hosts and services
ADDED   new history action "edited". It shows which items were changed. This improves the usability and tracking of changes a lot.
ADDED   CSV export script export_items_to_csv.pl (contributed by Yannick Charton)
ADDED   selecting a different checkcommand while adding a service will now update the default service parameters
ADDED   Active Directory authentication mode.
ADDED   locking system on 'generate config'. User will be stopped and warned if there is someone else already generating.
ADDED   when adding/modifying service parameters on a service, NConf will automatically trim spaces in front/end of value. (preventing copy/paste failures)
ADDED   bevore applying some inheritance from host to services, there is now also a preview of attributes, which would be removed from its services
ADDED   NConf will now check for updates and show an info box (only: if not disabled; if user belongs to admin group; on HOME page)
ADDED   progress bar to generate_config process
ADDED   multimodify of "assign_many" attributes (like contact_groups) now have a mode selection for how to apply the values: 
        override (as until now) or add as additional
ADDED   advanced-services which allow more liberty and can be assigned to multiple hosts and hostgroups
ADDED   syntax checking for static config folders. This functionality can be enabled/disabled using the new CHECK_STATIC_SYNTAX constant.
ADDED   script to link an additional contactgroup with existing hosts & services
ADDED   conversion script to make sure config is still generated the same way after an update to NConf 1.3 -> refer to the Update Information!
ADDED   "first_notification_delay" attribute to the classes host, service, advanced-service, host-template and service-template
ADDED   when debug mode is active, when a config is not generated successfully (doesn't pass the nagios binary check), an archive containing the config is generated in the output dir with a FAILED tag.
ADDED   HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION, including 2 new constants AUTH_METHOD and BASICAUTH_REALM

REMOVED 'extended_host_info.cfg' and 'extended_service_info.cfg' files. The original contents of those files are now written to 'hosts.cfg' 
        and 'services.cfg' respectively. Also, those properties are now available both on Collector and Monitor servers.
REMOVED 'call_ajax.php' -> replaced with 'call_file.php'
REMOVED add_item.php -> implemented as handle_item.php
REMOVED modify_item.php -> implemented as handle_item.php

MOVED   include/history_tab.php -> moved to tabs directory include/tabs/history.php
MOVED	5 attributes from timeperiods to hosts/services directly (max_check_attempts, notification_interval etc.) -> refer to the Update Information!
MOVED	5 attributes from collectors/monitors to hosts/services directly (active_checks_enabled, notifications_enabled etc.) -> refer to the Update Information!

CHANGED step2 will now redirect directly to 'modify service' which will add all services of selected host-preset
CHANGED 'message'-function: INFO,DEBUG etc. are now handled over the new class (NConf_DEBUG). Old message function only forwards to new class.
        Also the output of all types (INFO,DEBUG,ERROR and CRITICAL) is done over this class.
CHANGED Services view (on a host). Service list and adding services is now solved with jQuery/AJAX functions.
CHANGED Administration GUI:
        - 'attributes': add & modify improved GUI with help
        - 'classes': add & modify improved GUI with help
CHANGED 'members' attribute for hostgroups, servicegroups and contactgroups. Set the 'link_bidirectional' flag.
CHANGED 'parents' attribute for hosts: this attribute is now also written to the collector config

Release 1.2.6 (2009-11-26)

FIXED    'permission denied' bug when a 'normal' user tries to clear a form
FIXED    'unknown' user bug in history entry when generating updated Nagios config

ADDED    CSV importer and example scripts to import any type of items from a CSV file into NConf
ADDED    an ID-wrapper script (id_wrapper.php) that allows users to embed a link to the NConf 'details' page,
         knowing only the name of an item (item name and item class are passed as GET-parameters)
ADDED    configuration option OVERVIEW_QUANTITY_STANDARD
ADDED    configuration option SELECT_VALUE_SEPARATOR
ADDED    'host-template' class and attributes, added several predefined host-template items

         specify templates to be auto-assigned to each service which is linked with these items.
ADDED    'default_service_name' attribute to checkcommand class. This value will be used when adding new services instead of the checkcommand name.
ADDED    'notes' and 'notes_url' attributes to hostgroup and servicegroup classes.
ADDED    'stale_service_command' attribute to 'nagios-monitor' class. If set, this writes a 'dummy' check_command to all services on a 'nagios-monitor.
         The 'dummy' check_command is therefore no longer triggered by the 'active_checks_enabled' flag.
ADDED    new datatype 'assign_cust_order' to ConfigAttrs table and GUIs. This allows users to specify the order of how linked items 
         should be written to the config (necessary for 'use' attributes to define order of templates).

         the common error 'Unable to write to check_result_path'.
CHANGED  ConfigAttrs.link_as_child attribute in the database to ENUM('yes','no') NOT NULL default 'no'
CHANGED  several host, service, timeperiod, nagios-collector and nagios-monitor attributes from 'mandatory' to 'not mandatory'
